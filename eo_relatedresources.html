					<h1>EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES - RELATED RESOURCES</h1>
					<hr>
					<h3><a href="http://research2vrpractice.org">The Rehabilitation Research &amp; Training Center for Evidence-Based Practice in Vocational Rehabilitation</a></h3>
						<p>The Rehabilitation Research &amp; Training Center for Evidence-Based Practice in Vocational Rehabilitation (RRTC-EBP VR) is designed to generate knowledge and evidenced based vocational rehabilitation practices that improve employment rates, and quality of employment for persons with disabilities.</p>
					<h3><a href="https://cpr.bu.edu/research/completed/rrtc-2009-2014">The Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Improved Employment Outcomes for Individuals with Psychiatric Disabilities</a></h3>
						<p>The mission of the research program of this Rehabilitation Research and Training Center (RRTC) is to develop and evaluate new knowledge, and based on that new knowledge, to improve employment outcomes for individuals with psychiatric disabilities.</p>
					<h3><a href="http://www.umassmed.edu/transitionsrtc">University of Massachusetts Medical School</a></h3>
						<p>Transitions RTC’s mission is to promote the full participation in socially valued roles of transition –age youth and youth adults (14-30) with serious mental health conditions. They use the tools of research and knowledge transition in partnership with this at risk population to achieve this mission.</p>
					<h3><a href="http://www.thinkwork.org/rrtc/">Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Advancing Employment for Individuals with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities</a></h3>
						<p>This project is home to research, training, and outreach activities that promote employment for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). They are funded by the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research in the Administration for Community Living (ACL) in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
					<h3><a href="http://vr-rrtc.org/demandside/">The Vocational Rehabilitation Research and Training Center (VR-RRTC) on Demand-Side Strategies</a></h3>
						<p>The Vocational Rehabilitation Research and Training Center (VR-RRTC) on Demand-Side Strategies is a national center for improving vocational rehabilitation (VR) responsiveness to employer needs. The Institute for Community Inclusion, along with its partners theAlabama Department of Rehabilitation Services, Nebraska Vocational Rehabilitation Services, the Vermont Division of Vocational Rehabilitation, and the New England Council, will conduct a series of activities to learn how state VR agencies can meet employer needs in changing economic environments.</p>
					<h3><a href="http://www.blind.msstate.edu">The National Research and Training Center on Blindness and Low Vision</a></h3>
						<p>The National Research and Training Center on Blindness and Low Vision (NRTC) is the only U.S. Department of Health and Human Services funded center focused on employment outcomes of persons with blindness or low vision.</p>
					<h3><a href="http://www.researchondisability.org/epm-rrtc">Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Employment Policy and Measurement</a></h3>
						<p>The mission of the Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Employment Policy and Measurement (EPM-RRTC) is to support the disability and policy communities as they take on important policy issues. The Center will generate and translate new knowledge about disability employment policy and ways to measure the labor market experiences of people with disabilities. In doing so, the Center will improve the quality of information about program interactions, policy options, and employment outcomes, increase evidenced-based advocacy and policymaking, foster more effective policies and practices, and ultimately, increase employment for people with disabilities.</p>
					<h3><a href="http://www.researchondisability.org">The Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Individual-Level Characteristics Related to Employment Among Individuals with Disabilities</a></h3>
						<p>The Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Individual-Level Characteristics Related to Employment Among Individuals with Disabilities (IC-RRTC) is generating new knowledge about the role of individual characteristics on employment outcomes. Despite the ADA and advances in medicine and technology, people with disabilities, as a group, have become economically less self-sufficient over the last few decades. Employment rates have declined, reliance on public benefits has increased, and household incomes have fallen further behind those of other households. However, some individuals with disabilities fare relatively well in the labor market and more can be learned about the factors that facilitate their success. The IC-RRTC will work toward improving strategies and interventions designed to foster better employment outcomes for the various subpopulations of people with disabilities.</p>
					<h3><a href="http://www.employerpracticesrrtc.org">The Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Employer Practices Related to the Employment Outcomes Among Individuals with Disabilities</a></h3>
						<p>The Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Employer Practices Related to the Employment Outcomes Among Individuals with Disabilities (EPRRTC) seeks to create new knowledge of specific employer practices most strongly associated with desired employment outcomes for individuals with disabilities and the prevalence of these practices.</p>
					 <h3><a href="http://www.vcurrtc.org">Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Employment of People with Physical Disabilities</a></h3>
						<p>The purpose of the VCU-RRTC is to conduct advanced research, training, technical assistance, and dissemination activities specifically to improve the employment outcomes of individuals with physical disabilities.</p>
					<h3><a href="http://www.ncwd-youth.info/topic/assessment">National Collaborative on Workforce Development and Disability for Youth</a></h3>
						<p>NCWD/Youth is your source for information about employment and youth with disabilities. Our partners — experts in disability, education, employment, and workforce development — strive to ensure you will be provided with the highest quality, most relevant information available.</p>
					<h3><a href="http://transitionta.org">National Technical Assistance Center on Transition</a></h3>
						<p>NTACT’s purpose is to assist State Education Agencies, Local Education Agencies, State VR agencies, and VR service providers in implementing evidence-based and promising practices ensuring students with disabilities, including those with significant disabilities, graduate prepared for success in postsecondary education and employment.</p>
					<h3><a href="http://iel.org/vryouth-tac">Vocational Rehabilitation Youth Technical Assistance Center</a></h3>
						<p>The VR Y-TAC, through a cooperative agreement with RSA, will provide state vocational rehabilitation (VR) programs and related rehabilitation professionals with technical assistance and training to help more effectively serve youth with disabilities. Specifically, the VR Y-TAC can assist your agency in serving all youth, including students with disabilities who are not receiving comprehensive special education services, such as students with 504 plans and other “potentially eligible” young people; youth connected to other systems, such as youth in or again out of foster care and court-involved, homeless, and runaway youth; and other disconnected, hard-to-serve, and at-risk youth populations.</p>
