					<h1>What works in youth transition: Evaluating the impacts of a comprehensive transition intervention in vocational rehabilitation</h1>
					<hr>
					<h2>Study Leads and Organizations</h2>
						<ul class="advisory">
							<li>Ellen Fabian – University of Maryland College Park</li>
							<li>Debra Neubert – University of Maryland College Park</li>
							<li>Richard Luecking – TransCen, Inc.</li>
							<li>Todd Honeycutt – Mathematica Policy Research</li>
						</ul>
					<h2>Study Description</h2>
						<p>This mixed-methods study will evaluate the impacts of a standardized multisite, multiyear model transition intervention funded by the U.S. Rehabilitation Services Administration and implemented by the Maryland State Division of Rehabilitation Services (DORS) from 2007 through 2012. This study leverages federal funds that supported the design and implementation of a model transition intervention and expands its benefits to critical transition stakeholders. The model transition intervention, the Maryland Seamless Transition Collaborative (MSTC), was funded by RSA to design and evaluate a comprehensive transition intervention offered to approximately 450 youth ages 16 to 22 at 11 school districts, or county sites throughout the state.</p>
					<h2>Purpose of the Study</h2>
						<p>The purpose of the study is to provide new, accessible knowledge to the field regarding the impacts, outcomes, and costs of a standardized transition intervention designed around a conceptual framework consistent with the best practices guidelines of the National Collaborative on Workforce & Disability’s Guideposts for Success in Transition. Specifically, we are interested in determining the extent to which a comprehensive transition intervention model offered collaboratively by state vocational rehabilitation and school districts improves VR closure outcomes and long-term earnings.</p>
					<h2>Research Questions</h2>
						<ul class="advisory">
							<li>RQ 1 – What are the overall impacts of the transition intervention on youth employment outcomes in vocational rehabilitation?</li>
							<li>RQ 2 – What policies, procedures, or practices implemented by stakeholders involved in the MSTC model are perceived as the most feasible, effective, and replicable?</li>
						</ul>
					<h2>Methodology</h2>
						<p>This mixed-methods study uses both a quantitative and qualitative research approach. The quantitative aspect of the study will address the overall impacts of the model on youth employment outcomes by comparing VR case closures, VR service costs, and wages for youth receiving MSTC services to non-MSTC youth in a longitudinal state-wide design. The qualitative aspect of the study is designed to identify which MSTC program elements participating staff (VR, transition, adult service provider) characterize as the most effective and enduring in improving their practices and outcomes for transitioning youth.</p>
						<p>Quantitative Analyses. To test the hypotheses, we will analyze RSA-911 data from the Maryland Division of Rehabilitation Services (DORS) AWARE case management system matched to 12 month earnings data retrieved from the Maryland Department of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation for youth who received MSTC services. We will compare these outcomes to those of youth both within MSTC districts but who did not receive MSTC services, and matched to school districts in other parts of the state not involved in the model transition intervention.</p>
						<p>Qualitative Analyses. We will design a semi-structured interview protocol designed to capture key informant perceptions of: (1) personal experiences in the MSTC intervention and how they compare to working with non-MSTC youth; (2) perceptions of systemic and individual barriers to implementation of the intervention; (3) strategies used to address implementation barriers; (4) overall perceptions of the efficacy and usefulness of the intervention; and (5) perceptions of the effects of the intervention on youth engagement in VR, including access to services, early withdrawal, and service duration.</p>
