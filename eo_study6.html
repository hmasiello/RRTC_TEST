				<h1>Proposing design options for a rigorous impact evaluation of Project SEARCH</h1>

				<h2>Study Description</h2>
					<p>In this study we present several design options for a rigorous impact evaluation of Project SEARCH. Project SEARCH is a high school to work transition program that has emerged as a promising program to address the challenges related to improving employment outcomes of youth with disabilities. Based on information we gathered from document reviews and from site visits conducted for this evaluability assessment, the study presents two leading evaluation designs. First, under the existing setting scenario, we propose a matched comparison group design. Second, under a demonstration scenario, we propose a randomized experimental evaluation. We also discuss a few other alternative design options, but they are less appealing than those recommended.</p>
				<h2>Purpose of the Study</h2>
					<p>The purpose of the study was to conduct an evaluability assessment for Project SEARCH. The program works closely with vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies, and focuses on improving prospects of integrated employment for transition age youth with disabilities. Because VR agencies are putting renewed attention to both of these elements with the promulgation of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, the study creates an opportunity to assess whether the program’s interactions with VR agencies could be evaluated rigorously.</p>
				<h2>Research Questions</h2>
					<p>The study addresses one key research question: What evaluation approaches are feasible for conducting a rigorous impact evaluation of Project SEARCH?</p>
				<h2>Methodology</h2>
					<p>To address this question, we conducted an evaluability assessment using information we gathered from document reviews and site visits. The documents we reviewed provided information on the principles of program intake. We supplemented that with information from site visits with Project SEARCH sites—in and around Cincinnati, Ohio and Orlando, Florida—and assessed how the documented guidelines are implemented in practice. During the site visits, we met not only with Project SEARCH staff, but also with staff from other local and state agencies that collaborate with the program, including schools, school districts, VR, and developmental disability agencies. When meeting with staff from other agencies, we also discussed the scope for collecting and sharing data on the youth from those agencies that could be used for an impact evaluation.</p>
				<h2>Recommendations</h2>
					<p>Based on information we gathered from document reviews and from site visits conducted for this evaluability assessment, we propose two leading evaluation designs: one under the existing setting, where we take Project SEARCH sites, students, and other partners as given; and another under a demonstration setting, where we allow for the evaluation to play a role in determining the setting within which these players interact.</p>
					<ul class="advisory">
						<li><strong>Existing setting design.</strong> Under the existing setting scenario, we propose a matched comparison group design with eligible youth from areas not served by Project SEARCH matched with individuals from areas served by the program.</li>
						<li class="lastbullet"><strong>Demonstration design.</strong> Under a demonstration scenario, we propose a randomized experimental evaluation with school districts/local education agencies randomly assigning youth enrolled in the demonstration either to a treatment group that would have the opportunity to apply for Project SEARCH services, or to a control group that would have the opportunity to receive usual services from the state VR agency.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>For practical reasons, we recommend pursuit of the existing setting design first. We believe this design would meet the standards of rigor necessary for the findings to be credibly used to inform policy and, importantly, would be by far the most feasible and least expensive to implement. Even though the demonstration setting design uses what program evaluators would call the gold standard for impact evaluation, a randomized controlled trial, it also would involve significantly more resources and a longer time frame to implement. Implementing either of the leading evaluation designs would require collaboration with Project SEARCH and other entities.</p>
