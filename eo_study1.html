					<h1>The association between individual-and agency-level factors and employment-related outcomes of transition-age youth seeking vocational rehabilitation services</h1>
					<hr>
					<h2>Study Leads and Organizations</h2>
						<ul class="advisory">
							<li>Todd Honeycutt - Mathematica Policy Research</li>
							<li>Frank Martin - Mathematica Policy Research</li>
						</ul>
					<h2>Study Description</h2>
						<p>This study will analyze Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA)-911 case service records, matched to Social Security Administration (SSA) administrative and earnings data, to document the services and employment-related outcomes of youth and young adults with disabilities served by State Vocational Rehabilitation Agencies (SVRAs). Using the matched data allows us to analyze employment-related outcomes beyond those observed in RSA-911 data alone. We will document long-term employment outcomes for former youth vocational rehabilitation (VR) clients and examine how they vary by individual- and agency-level characteristics.</p>
					<h2>Purpose of the Study</h2>
						<p>The purpose of this study is to provide NIDILRR and other stakeholders with a better understanding of the variation across SVRAs in the individual-and agency-level factors related to serving transition-age youth, and to determine how the variations are related to youth’s employment outcomes. Our results may help identify potential policy changes that could improve employment-related outcomes for this population.</p>
					<h2>Research Questions</h2>
						<p>The study will test four questions, each related to several types of outcomes, including VR service receipt, employment at VR service case closure, long-term employment, earnings, and SSA program participation.</p>
						<ul class="advisory">
							<li>RQ 1 – How do SVRAs vary in their employment-related outcomes for youth seeking services? Differences across SVRAs would be consistent with observations that agencies vary widely across other types of characteristics.</li>
							<li>RQ 2 – How will employment-related outcomes differ by youths’ individual-level characteristics (such as age at application and sex)? Other studies have found differences in service use and exiting with employment (such as by gender, race, disability status, and SSA benefit status) and we expect the same to be true of employment-related outcomes for youth.</li>
							<li>RQ 3 – How will employment-related outcomes vary by access to and receipt of VR services? Service factors that may be positively related to the employment-related outcomes for youth include the receipt of VR services, length of time to writing the Individual Plan for Employment (IPE), and the types of services provided.</li>
							<li>RQ 4 – How do employment-related outcomes vary by agency-level characteristics? We expect that agencies that are in ordered selection or that have declines in total annual expenditures will have negative outcomes for their youth applicants.</li>
						</ul>
					<h2>Sample Population</h2>
						<p>We will use RSA-911 data for federal fiscal years 2004 through 2013, matched to SSA administrative records, to develop application and closure cohort files for youth and young adults who applied for VR services in fiscal years 2004 through 2007. The RSA-911 data contain information on each person who exited VR services during a fiscal year. By using several years of closure files, we can identify approximately 80 to 90 percent of applicants in a given year. Creating applicant cohorts allows us to identify patterns of youth who apply at similar times, so that they face similar economic environments and conditions. The match rate of the RSA-911 data to the Disability Analysis File (DAF) is approximately 95 percent. Therefore, we anticipate a sample of about 150,000 VR applicants ages 16 to 24 in each year, or about 600,000 youth in total.</p>
					<h2>Methodology</h2>
						<p>The data source most central to our analysis is the RSA-911 file. The RSA-911 file contains a wealth of information about VR clients at the individual level. Using this data source, we can observe individual-level characteristics of transition-age SVRA clients, the services they received, and their case closure status. However, the RSA-911 file does not allow us to track the employment and earnings of VR clients before they apply for services, at the time of closure if they do not receive services, or at any time after they exit VR. By linking the RSA-911 file to data from the Master Earnings File (MEF), we can measure employment and earnings outcomes during these periods. The MEF is provided to SSA by the Internal Revenue Service, is updated annually, and contains earnings information for all individuals based on tax returns. We also will link RSA-911 and MEF data to the DAF. The DAF contains a longitudinal record for every person age 10 through the Social Security full retirement age (currently age 66) who received Social Security or SSI disability benefits at any time from 1996 on. By matching these data to RSA-911 records, we can identify which VR youth applicants received benefits when they applied for VR services or any time thereafter, as well as those who attempt to use SSA work supports, such as Ticket to Work.</p>
						<p>These data sources will allow us to analyze several factors that may be influential for young adult transitions. The variables in the analysis will span five categories:</p>
						<p><strong>Individual-level characteristics</strong> include traits, such as age at application, gender, race/ethnicity, disability type, earnings before SVRA application, and education level, that are likely correlated with VR service receipt and employment outcomes.</p>
						<p><strong>Agency access variables</strong> capture the extent to which transition-age youth wait for and receive VR services. Examples include the percentage of youth receiving VR services and time to IPE of those receiving services.</p>
						<p><strong>Agency service variables</strong> describe the type and amount of services a client receives, such as cost of services, time from application to closure, and services received.</p>
						<p><strong>Agency-level characteristics</strong> capture information on SVRAs that may influence outcomes. Examples include an agency’s ordered selection status, annual total expenditures, level of federal funding, wait time for services, percentage receiving postsecondary services, percentage applying for services before age 19, and cost of services.</p>
						<p><strong>Employment-related outcomes</strong> measure how VR clients fare when they exit SVRAs and afterward. We will consider the following types of outcomes:</p>
							<ul class="advisory">
							<li><strong>VR outcomes</strong> describe clients’ status when they exit VR. Key variables include exiting VR with employment status and exiting before service receipt but after eligibility status.</li>
							<li><strong>Earnings outcomes</strong>, based on the MEF, measure median earnings before and after the VR application year. We also will examine the percentage of VR clients with any earnings in the years after application.</li>
							<li><strong>SSA outcomes</strong> identify VR clients who received SSA disability supports when they applied for VR services, as well as the percentage who received SSA disability supports after exiting VR.</li>
